# hackathon2021-RachaelSonya
This repository monitors the status of the Rachael & Sonya's 2021 Hackathon project. It is an app that allows beginner students to review their math skills (grade 1). It adresses the issues of quality education, but also no poverty through its fundraising aspect. The user enters their answer to a math question, and the program tells them if they answered correctly. Every correct answer means 2 cents are donated towards ending poverty.
